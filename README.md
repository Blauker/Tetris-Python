# Tetris by Blauker
This is my version of tetris created with Python 

# Controlls
A-> Move piece to the left <br />
S-> Move down the piece <br />
D-> Move piece to the right <br />
W-> Rotate the piece <br />

# Install
You will need python 3.10+ <br/>
Download the zip and extract it anywhere <br/>
Since I used emojis ["ğŸŸ¥", "ğŸŸ§", "ğŸŸ¨", "ğŸŸ©", "ğŸŸ¦", "ğŸŸª", "ğŸŸ«"] to create the blocks, it wont run on cmd <br/>
You can run it easy on VSC
